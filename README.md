### Multi-PDF RAG Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot that can answer questions based on information extracted from multiple PDF documents. The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which combines retrieval and generation techniques to provide relevant and coherent responses. The project leverages LangChain, a framework for building applications with large language models, and Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Features

- Supports multiple PDF documents as knowledge sources

- Allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on the provided PDFs

- Utilizes a RAG model for improved response quality and relevance

- Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

- LangChain library

- Streamlit library

- Hugging Face Transformers library
